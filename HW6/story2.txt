Barack Obama has announced that his sleepy 
clothing store in the heart of downtown Timbuktu is having 
a/an lazy sale of all merchandise, including 
fat suits and slightly irregular spleens 
available. Men's cable-knit bazookas , only $15.99. 
Hand-woven Italian Star Wars action figures , 1/2-price. Double- 
breasted cashmere toilets , $50.00. Genuine imported 
pink greasy shoes, itchy handerchiefs, 
and women's embroidered laptops , all at rock-bottom prices. 
This is a chance to get some really crappy bargains.
